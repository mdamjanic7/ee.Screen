# ee.Screen

This script takes screenshots of web pages according to a list of URLs. Supports various resolutions and multiple formats - JPG, PDF, PNG and TXT

### [>> download version 20220426](https://github.com/rytsikau/ee.Screen/raw/master/ee.Screen_20220426.zip)



## Requirements

To run the script, you need to install the NodeJS framework and Google Chrome Puppeteer. To install NodeJS, visit page [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). To install Puppeteer, after NodeJS is installed, open a Windows command prompt and type

**`npm install --save puppeteer`**



## Quick Start

1. Unpack the downloaded archive
2. Open *urls.txt* in a text editor and paste the URLs of the required pages instead of the existing samples
3. Save *urls.txt*, then run *start.bat*
4. See screenshots in the *..\screenshots* directory



## Usage

The url list file must be encoded with any Unicode type as long as it contains non-latin letters. Run from Windows command line:

**`node "c:\path\to\ee.screen.js" "c:\path\to\url\list\file.txt"`**

The file line format is as follows:

**`url;"path\to\screenshots\screenshotFilename.*";width*height;commaSeparatedFormats`**

All values except 'url' are optional, default values are:

```
..\screenshots\[flaturl].*  - screenshot has 'flat' url as filename
1280*full                   - width is 1280p, height - full page height
png                         - screenshot format
```

* Encoding of TXT screenshots is UTF8
* If screenshot already exists in the directory, a new one is not created
* Screenshots in PDF and TXT formats are always taken at full page height (PDF - paginated in A4 with 100% scale, TXT - in accordance with HTML markup)
* The order of the parameters in the file line does not matter
* The path and name of the screenshot must be in quotes
* To take a PDF screenshot in landscape orientation specify 'Lpdf' instead of 'pdf'

Examples:

>     https://github.com

* saves screenshot as *..\screenshots\https_github.com_.png* with 1280p width and full page height

>     txt,pdf;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news

* saves two screenshots of TXT and PDF formats in the same directory

>     https://hp.com/;jpg,Lpdf;1024*768

* saves part of the page as JPG screenshot with a resolution of 1024*768, and the whole page as PDF screenshot in landscape orientation

>     1920*full;"C:\My Screenshots\123.*";https://www.ebay.com/;png

* saves PNG screenshot with 1920p width and full page height in the *C:\My Screenshots* directory with the name *123.png*
